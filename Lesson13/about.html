                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <p>Carlsbad’s earliest residents were the  Luiseño Indians who settled the coastal area. The Luiseño people were successful in living off the land using a number of natural resources to provide food and clothing. They had a close relationship with their natural environment. They used many of the native plants, harvesting many kinds of seeds, berries, nuts, fruits, and vegetables for a varied and nutritious diet. The land also was inhabited by many different species of animals which the men hunted for game and skins. Hunters took antelopes, bobcats, deer, elk, foxes, mice, mountain lions, rabbits, wood rats, river otters, ground squirrels, and a wide variety of insects.  These Native Americans people were here at the time of the first contacts with the Spanish in the 16th century.
                    <br>
                    The Spanish missions in California comprise a series of 21 religious outpost were established between 1769 and 1833. The missions led to the creation of the New Spain province of Alta California and were part of the expansion of the Spanish Empire into the most northern and western parts of Spanish North America.
                    <br>
                    In 1821, Mexico achieved independence from Spain, taking Alta California along with it, but the missions maintained authority over native people and control of land holdings until the 1830s. The Alta California government secularized the missions after the passage of the Mexican secularization act of 1833. This divided the mission lands into land grants, which became many of the Ranchos of California. During the Mexican period, in 1842, the southern portion of Carlsbad, was granted as Rancho Agua Hedionda to Juan María Marrón.

                    In the 1882 Captain John Frazier dug a well near the coast in Carlsbad. He began offering his water at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became known as Frazier’s Station. A test done on a second fresh-water well discovered the water to be chemically similar to that found in some of the most renowned spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in the Bohemian town of Karlsbad</p>
