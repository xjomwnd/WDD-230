          <h1>A History of Preston, Idaho</h1>

          <p>
            Preston, Idaho, a small agricultural community in northern Cache Valley, in early times was a hunting ground for Indians who camped nearby. The first white men to visit the area were trappers, immigrants and explorers. Mormon settlers had pushed to Its borders by 1860.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1866, Latter-day Saint (LDS, or Mormon) pioneers arrived in the northern end of the Cache Valley, stretching across southeastern Idaho and northeastern Utah. They founded a community in that location and named it Worm Creek, but in 1881 changed it to Preston because leaders of the LDS Church in Salt Lake City objected to the name "Worm Creek" being part of any church congregation's name. The name Preston was suggested by a local member to honor William B. Preston, who at the time was president of the LDS Church's Cache Stake.

It was not until the 1880s while William C. Parkinson was serving as the bishop of the Preston LDS Ward that a regular townsite was laid out
