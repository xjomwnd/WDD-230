                <h2>Preston Pride</h2>
                <p>Unlike most of the other communities of Cache Valley
                    which were originally settled by immigrating groups of Mormon
                    Pioneers, Preston developed first as an outlying farming area
                    bordering more desirable lands and then arose in time as
                    Cache Valley's second largest city due to its more natural
                    location as a center for smaller communities. </p>

                    "Don't take anything to Lynn's. We took my truck in because the back-up camera wasn't working. 
                    They told me it needed a whole new camera and wiring ($500). I took it to another place and 
                    they reconnected the wires in 15 minutes and didn't even charge me a dime! Dishonest or unqualified???"</p>
