        <h2 class="home-headline-2">#2 – Lake Nakuru National Park</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">Lake Nakuru is just one of eight ‘soda lakes’ to be found in Kenya’s Rift Valley. Taking its name from the Masai term for ‘dusty place’, the lake itself is fairly shallow and inhospitable to most wildlife on account of its highly alkaline waters. These conditions, however, are ideally suited for algae – the principal food source of the lesser flamingo. The best time to see these brightly-coloured birds congregate on the lake is during the dry season (from June to August); the lower waters have a greater salinity during this period, which means an abundance of tasty algae for the flamingos. 

<br/><br/>Apart from the sight of hundreds of pink birds lining the shore, the Lake Nakuru area more generally holds some special wildlife-viewing opportunities. Due to a concerted conservation effort, for instance, around 150 white rhinos and 50 black rhinos can be found in the park. </p>

            <h2>#3 – Laikipia Plateau Reserve </h2>
            <p>Formerly used for ranching during the colonial era, the Laikipia Plateau consists of 9,500 square kilometres of land that extends from the base of Mount Kenya to the Northern Frontier District. The reserve is divided up into a number of conservancies, many of which concern themselves primarily with the protection of elephants. There are around 7,000 of these majestic animals within the reserve, and approximately a third of them undertake an annual migration northwards through age-old routes towards the Samburu Reserve.  

<br/><br/>Alongside elephants, visitors may also catch a glimpse of the lesser-known Grevy’s Zebra, which is one of Northern Kenya’s key endemic species. The reserve holds around a quarter of the total global population of this endangered species of zebra, which is distinguished from the more widely known plains zebra by narrower stripes, a white belly, dorsal stripe, round ears, and a brown muzzle. </p>
