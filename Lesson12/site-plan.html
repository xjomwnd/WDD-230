      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of Bountful Foods Processing, handling and storage is to prevent foodborne illness and injury,
         to safely preserve and package foods, and to transport foods from across the globe to our homes. We ensure 
         toxin removal, preservation, easing marketing and distribution tasks, and increasing food consistency.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our targeted audience in Bountful Foods are people interested in our food varieties. They are mostly people of high and low
        income and students from various institutions. Individuals working in a stressful environment, such as lawyers, directors, 
        and more, are the target audience. The tenseness that comes when they are feeding bountiful foods, will make them
        appreciate the satification and relax. Target audience are invited for orders through their phones or email.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/e63946-f1faee-a8dadc-457b9d-1d3557" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a></p>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#E63946]</td><td class="secondary">[#F1FAEE]</td><td class="accent1">[#A8DADC]</td><td class="accent2">[#A8DADC]</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Verdana, sans-serif;<!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        <p>I like the sans-serif look of Verdana. I find it easier to read.</p>
        <p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Helvetica, sans-serif;  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        <p>In writing documents, I usually use Helvetica because it's easier to read online following the spacing between letters.</p>
      <p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        <p> When specifying a web font in a CSS style, always list at least one
        fallback web-safe font in order to avoid unexpected behaviors</p>
      </h4>

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.

        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
