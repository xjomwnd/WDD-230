                        <p>Fasting is a phased process. It is necessary to know how to proceed step by step. It is also
                            important to note that fasting does not mean that you cannot eat anything during the fasting
                            period. Although the fasting process is very simple, there are many things to pay attention
                            to and taboos and they are very complicated.</p>
