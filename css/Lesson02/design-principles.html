            <h2>White Space</h2>

            <p>Even before I was studying web development, I always thought Xbox had a great looking site. In this
                screenshot we can see some great use of white space. The white space helps the whole page feel really
                clean and organized. It makes it feel like a modern website. As a bonus, this screenshot presents some
                great contrast between the green icons and the stark white background.</p>

            <p>This company has brilliantly describes Fitt's law. It is very clear what the company wants you to do.
                They want you to get the Mix app. The company made the button to get the app huge and close to where the
                user would rest there thumb so that it is easy to press.</p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>

            <img src="images/Repetition.png" alt="A picture that demonstrates Fitt's Law">
            <p>MSN has a webpage that very clearly uses the prinicple of repetition. Their consistency with how
                theyorganize and present their articles provides organized flow through the articles. It also helps them
                keep you scrolling to the next article, which keeps you on their site.</p>
