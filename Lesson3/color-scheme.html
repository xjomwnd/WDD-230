                    <p>I generated the colors on <a href="https://coolors.co/ff4a1c-ffffff-0eabf3-007abd-212529" target="_blank">Coolers</a> 
                        and I think it's a good combination for weather forecasting website, particularly the blue colors. 
                        The different shades of Blue are mainly for the menu and the Orange [ FF4A1C ] is for a call to action button. 
                        The [ 212529 ] is for the footer.</p>

                    <h2>Color Theory</h2>
                    <p>
                        Color is in the Beholders’ Eyes
                        Sir Isaac Newton established color theory when he invented the color wheel in 1666. Newton understood colors as human perceptions—not absolute qualities—of wavelengths of light. By systematically categorizing colors, he defined three groups:
                        
                        Primary (red, blue, yellow)
                        
                        Secondary (mixes of primary colors)
                        
                        Tertiary (or intermediate – mixes of primary and secondary colors)
                        
                        Following Newton’s findings, the study of color advanced to cover the properties of color in its two forms—i.e., print/paint and screen/light—and in a variety of fields, from art to astronomy. A color’s properties are:
                        
                        Hue – How it appears (e.g., “is green”).
                        
                        Chroma – How pure it is: i.e., if it has shades (black added), tints (white added) or tones (grey added).
                        
                        Lighting – How pale or saturated it appears.
                        
                        In user experience (UX) design, you need a firm grasp of color theory to craft harmonious, meaningful designs for your users.

                 <h2>Color in Contrast</h2>
                 <p>Contrast: Contrast is designing a distinct difference between foreground and background colors in order to enhance readability. Contrast does not only deal with colors but also blends into visual hierarchy of font sizes, image placement, and content.</p>
                <p>People say that opposites attract and this can be true for elements of design as well. Imagine a composition without contrast –every color, font, shape, etc. would be the same size, and that design would be rather dull. Contrast is the tool that makes a design “pop,” making it memorable for viewers.</p>
